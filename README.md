### README Update: CS 300 Projects and Reflections

Problem Solving in the Projects:
In this course, the primary challenge was to develop efficient data structures and algorithms to manage and manipulate educational course information for the Computer Science program. The goal was to create a robust system capable of storing course details, including prerequisites, and allow users to retrieve and display this information effectively.

Approach to the Problem:
I approached this problem by first analyzing the requirements for handling course data. Understanding data structures is crucial as it directly impacts the efficiency of operations, such as adding, retrieving, and sorting data. For instance, I utilized vectors for simple storage and retrieval tasks, hash tables for optimal lookup performance, and binary search trees for maintaining ordered data efficiently.

Overcoming Roadblocks:
Throughout the project, I encountered a few roadblocks, such as challenges with file input/output operations and ensuring the correct handling of prerequisites for each course. I overcame these difficulties by breaking down the issues into smaller tasks and using debugging techniques. I also referenced documentation and sought help from classmates when needed, which reinforced my understanding of the concepts involved.

Evolution of My Software Design Approach:
Working on these projects has significantly expanded my approach to designing software. I learned to prioritize the selection of appropriate data structures based on the specific use case and performance needs. The experience has taught me to think critically about scalability and efficiency from the outset of the design process, which will be invaluable in future projects.

Writing Maintainable and Adaptable Programs:
This experience has evolved my coding practices towards creating maintainable and readable code. I focused on clear naming conventions and modular design, making it easier for anyone (including my future self) to understand and modify the codebase. I also incorporated comments explaining complex sections, enhancing the overall readability and adaptability of the programs.
